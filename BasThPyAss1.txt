2)Difference between string and variable
String is a value which represents some text, whereas variable 
refers to some value or holds a value
String is written in '' or " " or """ """ and variable is not surrounded
with any quotes

3)Three different data types-->int--holds integer values
  float-holds floating values
  bool-holds true/false
  string-holds text

4)Expression is made up of operators and variables/values.It is basically
used to check some conditions or evaluating the result

5)Assignment is giving a variable some value whereas expression is a cmbination
of some variables and operators that can be evaluated to some 
value.Expressions can also be used for assignment like a=1+2*3

10)'I have eaten'+99+'burritos' gives error stating tht the string 
can't be concatenated with int type.It can be fixed by converting int to string
    'I have eaten'+str(99)+'burritos'
